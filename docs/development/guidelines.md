======
User Interface?
Naming convections - for classes, instances, input parameters?
Class overview?


Directory Structure
===================

* libUnderworld            - Backend stack of tools (Underworld, StgFEM, etc)
 * libUnderworldPy         - Swig generated wrappers for backend as well as auxiliary implementations (such as StGermain_Tools)
* underworld               - Underworld python modules
* glucifer                 - gLucifer python modules
* docs                     - contains various documentation including this file
* UserGuide                - contains various examples input files



Coding Style
============

Documentation
-------------
Largely follow the numpy/scipy docstring conventions:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt#docstring-standard


Whitespace
----------
PEP 8
http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

also check YAPF for python, and clang-format for c

Most importantly:
Spaces should be used for tabs.
Indent levels should be 4 spaces deep.

autopep8 tool can be used to tidy when necessary:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8/

This command seems to give good results (not overly aggressive):
autopep8 -v -i -r  --ignore E201,E202,E501,E221,E251 .


Naming Conventions
-----------------
module_name, package_name, ClassName, function_name, method_name, ExceptionName, propertyName
GLOBAL_CONSTANT_NAME, globalVarName, instanceVarName, functionParameterName, localVarName

An exception to the above naming convention are classes within the Function module. These
classes are generally (from the user interface perspective) utilised as functions, and 
therefore they use the 'function_name' style naming. This is also for consistency with
other python modules (such as 'math' and 'numpy'). 


License 
=======
See LICENSE.md file in project top directory


Version Control
===============

We follow the Gitflow Workflow:
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/

Features branches should be created for anything besides quick fixes. Once ready for 
publishing to the development branch, a pull request should be created and another 
team member nominated to review the changes. Pull request should only be merged 
once the following criterion are met:
1. Any new functionality is sufficiently tested (via doctest or other means).
2. Any new functionality is sufficiently documented.
3. All tests pass. 


Bug reporting
=============

Use the github issue tracker! Changes relating to issue tracker issues should register
which issue they relate to in the commit log. 


Testing
=======

Jenkins continuous testing system - see http://jenkins-ci.org/
(followed setup instructions from https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+on+Ubuntu )

Backend setup:
On a virtual machine we have at - https://130.56.248.95:8080
JENKINS_HOME=/mnt/scratch/testing_platform/jenkins

Script to run server is = /etc/init.d/jenkins
configuration file = /etc/default/jenkins

To start/stop/restart the server use
sudo /etc/init.d/jenkins {start|stop|restart}

Front end setup:
goto https://130.56.248.95:8080 and log in with 
username = banana
password = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InsspuvAmBs

Using the front-end one can configure the build system, security feature, email notifications etc.
(Note: Iâ€™ve never been able to get the email notification happening because the virtual machines have some problem communicating out of them - i suspect port blocking by nectar guys)

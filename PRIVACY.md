Privacy
=======

Basic information about Underworld usage is collected via Google Analytics. This 
information helps us to further develop and improve Underworld. 

We collect **only** the following information:

* Platform type (eg. Darwin, linux, docker, etc).
* Number of processes being utilised.
* Underworld version.

A random number (generated at configure time) is also used to help distinguish 
unique users. Google Analytics also provides an anonymised version of your IP 
for geolocational purposes. 

For implementation details, see 'underworld/__init__.py' and 'underworld/_net/__init__.py'
